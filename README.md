- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am a software engineer and I chose it because I found my true passion in programming. During my school days I used to play computer games and I was very curious about those games. I was a big fan of hacking based movies.
I took my first programming class in 2015 and found it more interesting than my favorite subjects at that time. So, I chose computer science as my major and started teaching myself how to code. After a year, I knew that this is what I wanted to do with my life.
I have Ability to translate business requirements into technical solutions. Looking to start the career as a software engineer where I can explore my knowledge and skills. I am ready to relocate in India and overseas.
